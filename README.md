# ðŸ¦† Duck Hunt Remake ðŸ¦†

Hello, dear gaming enthusiasts and fellow developers!

Welcome to the Duck Hunt Remake repository. This project is a labour of love, a nostalgic dive into the past with a modern twist. I've embarked on this journey using the Godot engine but with a unique approach. Due to the current limitations of Godot 4.0.3, which doesn't support builds for Android, IOS, and HTML5, I've utilised two distinct versions of Godot: 4.0.3 and 3.5.2.

## ðŸŒ² Branches:
This main branch is primarily a guidepost, directing you to the heart of our project. Choose a branch below to explore the game's code and assets:

**Godot 4.0.3:** For the desktop experience, dive into the [Godot-v4.0.3 branch](https://github.com/ItsAnunesS/DuckHunterRemake/tree/Godot-v4.0.3).

**Godot 3.5.2:** For Android, IOS, and HTML5 builds, head over to the [Godot-v3.5.2 branch](https://github.com/ItsAnunesS/DuckHunterRemake/tree/Godot-v3.5.2).
